So you've been probably wondering what you can find on this blog.

The name is Unhinged Cogs, that means that we'll unhinge some cogs, rip apart the cables, disembowel the inners, dislocate the limbs, cut things in half and most importantly, reinvent the wheel.

But don't worry, you'll not find butchery content here, no. Only tech, mostly programming stuff. I like unconventional solutions and writing stuff from scratch.

...

Where are my maneers.

I didn't even introduced myself.

So, my name is Krzysztof Krysiński (good luck pronouncing that) and I've been programming for plenty years now (about 9). 
I am the creator and core maintainer of [PixiEditor](https://pixieditor.net).

> You're almost half a year late with PixiEditor 2.0, why on earth are you spending the weekend on making a blog

uh, well, first of all, fuck you. I can do whatever I want, if I'll starve that's on me.

Second of all, I think this is my exercise of journaling. I tried doing it many times, but without much success. I have no clue how people are able to open obisidian daily and create thousands of notes
that no one else will read, likely not even themselves ever, like bunch of psychopaths. 

And here I am, doing exactly the same but fooling myself that someone will read this too.

Ngl, it feels pretty nice. But I won't share random bullshit from my life, don't worry. Only stuff that is at least half interesting, I have a bunch of cool stuff to show off that never seen light day.

So I guess that is it.
